OK

This is where I write out random things I think about my program

I am going to make a program that tracks one summoner and helps to keep average stats
for them, as well as keeping track of arbitrary conditions in order to help assist
in knowing if the summoner should play solo q.

Ill start with the potential arbitrary conditions
1. Number of losses in a row. Im thinking if the user has 3 or more losses in a row
2. playing a champion the summoner has <10 games on
3. teammate is playing a champion that they have <10 games on
4. teammate is playing a champion with <45% winrate
5.how long summoner has been playing
6.rank and previous ranks of teammates

first step is to be able to acquire a summoners match history
